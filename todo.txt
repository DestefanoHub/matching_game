CURRENT
_______

- Adjust the login form so the form validation makes more sense and isn't just the copy from the create form.
- Have the app handle the validation messages instead of the API returning them directly.
- Make sure the app handles API errors properly.

FUTURE
______

- Remove the modal for starting a new game and have it display directly on the page instead.
    - When selecting a difficulty option, show an example of the game board so players can see the difference in difficulty.
- Have the API requests timeout after a period of time.
- Add a delay to show the loading state of game history.
